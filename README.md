# MonteCarlo_TemperatureMeasurement
The notebook created in Colab allows to perform Monte Carlo analysis for the accuracy of the mass production electrical circuits capable of measuring the temperature. The components of the systems are: an NTC sensor, a resistor connected in series with the NTC sensor, a voltage suppy and an analog to digital converter (ADC). Diagrams in the notebook presents the circuits. The input data is: R-T table of the NTC sensor and its Cpk (process capability of NTC sensor manufacturing), nominal resistance and Cpk of the resistor, a voltage tolerance, ADC error and software table for translating ADC output into temperature values. The output of the analysis is the temperature accuracy for the NTC sensor itself and the whole system for each temperature from R-T table. That shows how much variation of the system comes from the sensor.
